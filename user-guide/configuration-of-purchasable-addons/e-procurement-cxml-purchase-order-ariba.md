# E-Procurement (cXML Purchase Order / Ariba)

{% hint style="info" %}
We have two different purchaseable addons that are licensed separately.&#x20;

_One for "_[_OCI-Punchout_](e-procurement-oci-punchout.md)_" and one for_ [_cXML/Ariba-Punchout_](e-procurement-cxml-purchase-order-ariba.md) _!_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note:: You cannot test cXML locally. The store must be publicly accessible.
