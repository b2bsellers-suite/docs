# Bonus program

The shop operator has the option of granting his customers benefits for online purchases made. The bonus program is included as a plug-in extension B2BBonusProgram in the CORE license of the B2Bsellers Suite.

## **Functionality**

The display of the bonus program in the shop frontend takes place via the output of a variable provided in TWIG. However, you can also use an experience element already provided in the B2B platform dashboard for the output of the available bonus amount. It is possible to determine whether a customer participates in the bonus program at all and you can also set whether a buyer may view the bonus value and thus also redeem it.

For orders placed, the bonus is calculated on the basis of the percentage value stored (additional field on the customer) and credited to the customer's bonus account. Optionally, the bonus can be redeemed by the customer in the shopping cart. For this purpose, the bonus is compensated in relation to the value of the shopping cart. The value on the bonus account will be automatically reduced by the amount offset.

### **Redeemed bonus value in the shopping cart**

Navigate in the administration to "My extensions" --> and open under "B2Bsellers Suite - Bonus program " in the overflow menu (3 dots) the "Configuration".

If the slide switch is activated, the approved buyer can have his bonus value offset against the purchase total in the shopping cart.

**Tip**: If deactivated, it is possible to credit the bonus value once a year as part of a marketing campaign.  But there are currently no plans for an automatic solution.
