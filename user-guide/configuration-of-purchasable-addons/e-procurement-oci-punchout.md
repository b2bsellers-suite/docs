## **E-Procurement as a Service**

Since the integration of OCI, cXML or punchout catalogs requires a lot of consulting and implementation effort, every e-procurement implementation is a project. You will get a consultant on your side who will help you to integrate the first customer into your e-procurement solution.

How is the integration done:

1. Contact our sales department
2. After a first free meeting with our sales department, we can offer you an offer including support for the first purchasing customer.
3. After order we install our extension in your environment, check all functions and configure together the first OCI/EDI/Punchout-Login.
4. We also contact the purchasing company and support your customer's IT/system integrator in case of any questions with the common goal
5. In the future, you as the store operator can create the accesses yourself with one click and send them to the purchasing company.
6. In case of problems on the side of the purchasing company, you are welcome to contact us through the support.&#x20;
