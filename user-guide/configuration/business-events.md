# B2B Flow/Business Events

## **What is the Shopware Flow Builder?**

With the Shopware Flow Builder, you can listen to trigger events and then initiate actions that are executed when the trigger events are called up.

Example: When an order has been triggered (trigger event), send an email to the customer as an order confirmation (action).
