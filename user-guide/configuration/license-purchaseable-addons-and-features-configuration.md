It couldn't be simpler. After the installation you can click in the administration in the main menu on B2B settings, then you come directly to the license settings.

#### What are the license restrictions?

This page is divided into the license restrictions, which are, for example, the maximum number of Sales representatives.

#### What are features?

These are free features that you can easily activate and use. These are included in the CORE license. Once you activate a feature you can make "Config Settings" on the left side. Good to know: All settings are normal Shopware config.xml settings like in every plugin.&#x20;

#### What are addons?

Addons are paid functions (which have to be licensed additionally). With B2BsellersCore you get the complete source code of all B2Bsellers Suite features.
